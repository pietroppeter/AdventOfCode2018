# Advent of Code 2018

Forked from [narimiran's AoC 2017](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2017), I plan to progressively fill in my solution for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

My goal is to have fun and learn [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/). Since I know better Python, I will try first to solve the puzzle using Python. Then port the code to Nim. Since I really want to learn Nim, I will not submit a solution until the Nim code works.

Task | Python solution | Nim solution | Note
--- | --- | --- | ---
[Day 1: Chronal Calibration](http://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1) | [day01.py](python/day01.py) | [day01.nim](nim/day01.nim) | At first I was not able to get Nim as fast as Python, still have to check exact times (remember to use d:release flag for nim)
