# Advent of Code 2018

Forked from [narimiran's AoC 2017](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2017), I plan to progressively fill in my solution for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

My goal is to have fun and learn [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/). Since I know better Python, I will try first to solve the puzzle using Python. Then port the code to Nim.
